# ActiveDirectory

1. How Active Directory, Domain Controller, Site and domain are related?

In Active Directory, a domain is a collection of objects that share the same Active Directory database. A domain controller is a server that manages the objects within a domain. It provides a central location for authentication and authorization of users on a network.

A site is a physical location within a network, often corresponding to a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) that contains one or more domain controllers. Each site has a unique IP address range, which allows domain controllers to communicate with one another efficiently.

In summary, a domain is a logical collection of objects within a network, a domain controller is a server that manages those objects, and a site is a physical location within the network where domain controllers are located. Together, these components form the core of the Active Directory infrastructure, which is used to manage users, groups, and other objects within a network.
