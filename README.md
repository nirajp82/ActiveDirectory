# ActiveDirectory

1. **How Active Directory, Domain Controller, Site and domain are related?**

In Active Directory, a domain is a collection of objects that share the same Active Directory database. A domain controller is a server that manages the objects within a domain. It provides a central location for authentication and authorization of users on a network.

A site is a physical location within a network, often corresponding to a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) that contains one or more domain controllers. Each site has a unique IP address range, which allows domain controllers to communicate with one another efficiently.

In summary, a domain is a logical collection of objects within a network, a domain controller is a server that manages those objects, and a site is a physical location within the network where domain controllers are located. Together, these components form the core of the Active Directory infrastructure, which is used to manage users, groups, and other objects within a network.

2. **What is object in a domain?**

In the context of Active Directory, an object is a data structure that represents a real-world entity, such as a user, group, computer, or network device. Objects have attributes, which are characteristics or properties of the object. For example, a user object might have attributes such as a username, password, and email address.

In a domain, objects are organized into a hierarchical structure, with the domain at the top and individual objects, such as users and groups, arranged in a tree-like structure beneath it. This allows for efficient management and organization of objects within the domain.

Objects in a domain can be managed using tools such as the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, which allows administrators to create, modify, and delete objects within the domain.
